# Memory Management Implementation Verification

## Task 12: 实现内存管理和资源清理

### Implemented Features:

#### 1. 动态内存分配跟踪 ✅
- Added `memory_block_t` structure to track allocated memory blocks
- Added `memory_state_t` structure to maintain memory statistics
- Implemented tracking functions:
  - `tracked_malloc()` - Tracks memory allocation with context and location
  - `tracked_realloc()` - Tracks memory reallocation
  - `tracked_strdup()` - Tracks string duplication
  - `tracked_free()` - Tracks memory deallocation

#### 2. 实现命令结构体的完整清理 ✅
- Updated `free_command()` function to use tracked memory functions
- Added proper NULL pointer checks and setting pointers to NULL after freeing
- Implemented complete cleanup of all command structure members:
  - Command name
  - Arguments array and individual arguments
  - Input/output redirection files

#### 3. 创建程序退出时的资源释放 ✅
- Enhanced `shell_cleanup()` function to:
  - Free current directory string using tracked memory
  - Call `cleanup_environment()` for environment variables
  - Print memory statistics before cleanup
  - Call `cleanup_error_system()` which includes memory tracking cleanup
- Updated `cleanup_memory_tracking()` to:
  - Print memory statistics
  - Check for memory leaks
  - Free all unfreed memory blocks
  - Log leak information

#### 4. 检查和修复内存泄漏 ✅
- Implemented memory leak detection functions:
  - `check_memory_leaks()` - Returns count of leaked memory blocks
  - `print_memory_leaks()` - Displays detailed leak information
  - `print_memory_stats()` - Shows comprehensive memory statistics
- Added memory tracking macros for easy use:
  - `TRACKED_MALLOC()`, `TRACKED_REALLOC()`, `TRACKED_STRDUP()`, `TRACKED_FREE()`
- Updated all source files to use tracked memory functions:
  - `parser.c` - Command parsing and tokenization
  - `environment.c` - Environment variable management
  - `io.c` - Input/output operations
  - `main.c` - Main shell operations

#### 5. Additional Features:
- Added `builtin_memstat` command to display memory statistics and leaks
- Enhanced error logging with memory allocation context
- Added memory tracking enable/disable functionality
- Implemented comprehensive memory statistics tracking:
  - Total allocations/deallocations
  - Current allocated memory
  - Peak memory usage
  - Outstanding memory blocks

### Code Changes Made:

1. **shell.h**: Added memory tracking structures and function declarations
2. **error.c**: Implemented complete memory tracking system
3. **parser.c**: Updated to use tracked memory functions
4. **environment.c**: Updated to use tracked memory functions
5. **io.c**: Updated to use tracked memory functions
6. **main.c**: Enhanced cleanup and initialization
7. **builtin.c**: Added memstat command

### Testing Verification:

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Compiling the shell: `gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -pedantic -g src/*.c -o myshell`
2. Running the shell and using the `memstat` command
3. Using `memstat leaks` to check for memory leaks
4. Observing memory statistics during shell exit

### Requirements Compliance:

- ✅ **Requirement 6.4**: Memory allocation failures are handled gracefully
- ✅ **Requirement 6.5**: System errors are recorded and shell continues running
- ✅ All memory allocations are tracked and can be monitored
- ✅ Complete resource cleanup on program exit
- ✅ Memory leak detection and reporting
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for memory operations

The implementation provides a robust memory management system that tracks all dynamic memory allocations, provides detailed statistics, detects memory leaks, and ensures complete resource cleanup when the shell exits.
